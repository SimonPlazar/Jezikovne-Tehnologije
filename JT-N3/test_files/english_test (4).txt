Living in a large city offers both advantages and challenges. One of the most significant benefits is access to public transportation, which allows residents to commute efficiently without relying on personal vehicles. However, as cities grow, public transport systems often become overwhelmed, leading to delays, overcrowding, and maintenance issues. To address this, urban planners are investing in smart transportation technologies, such as real-time tracking, electric buses, and bike-sharing programs. The goal is to make commuting more convenient, reduce traffic congestion, and lower pollution levels. While progress is being made, achieving a balance between development and sustainability remains a long-term challenge.
