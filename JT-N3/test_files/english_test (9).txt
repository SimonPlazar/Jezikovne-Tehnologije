Technology plays an essential role in shaping modern life. From smartphones and smart homes to online banking and digital healthcare, our daily routines are increasingly dependent on technological tools. These advancements have brought incredible convenience and connectivity, but they have also raised new concerns about privacy, security, and the loss of human interaction. Social media, for instance, connects billions of people but also contributes to issues like cyberbullying and misinformation. Finding a healthy balance in our relationship with technology is one of the most important challenges of the 21st century. Itâ€™s crucial to use technology mindfully and ensure it serves to enhance, rather than dominate, our lives.
