Modern healthcare systems are increasingly recognizing the importance of mental health alongside physical well-being. For decades, mental health issues were stigmatized and often ignored, but today, there's growing awareness and advocacy for treatment and support. Anxiety, depression, and burnout are among the most common issues affecting people across all age groups. Healthcare providers are integrating mental health services into primary care, and governments are funding awareness campaigns and support hotlines. Nevertheless, access to affordable mental healthcare remains a challenge, especially in rural or underserved areas. To truly improve public health, mental health must be treated with the same urgency and care as physical health.
